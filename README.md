#TextAnalyzer

![Screebshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mykyta-pavlov/TextAnalyzer/main/TextAnalyzer%20Screenshot.png)

The app uses Angular (frontend) and ASP.NET Core WebAPI (backend).

The input text is assessed by two indicators:
1. What percent of pronouns in the text (uses external API)
2. Number of spaces comparing to sample text

Note: Since the app uses external API as a dictionary to find if the word is pronoun, there is a little delay.
